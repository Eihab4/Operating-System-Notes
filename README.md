# Operating Systems

## Computer Components

1. **Input**
2. **Output**
3. **Memory**
4. **CPU**
   - **CU (Control Unit)**: Responsible for organizing the sequence and executing the micro-operations code.
   - **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**

## Memory

- **Two Types of Memory:**
  1. **Primary (Main) Memory**: 
     - Very fast but expensive.
     - Volatile: Data is lost when the power supply is cut off.
  2. **Secondary (Auxiliary) Memory**: 
     - Cheaper and slower.
     - Non-volatile: Data remains even when the power supply is cut off.

- **CPU and Memory:**
  - The CPU deals with primary memory only.
  - When a program is loaded into main memory for execution, it's known as the *stored program concept*.

## Registers

**Registers** are small, high-speed storage locations within the CPU used to hold data temporarily during calculations.

### Functions of Registers:
- **Data Storage:** Store data such as numbers, characters, or memory addresses that the CPU processes.
- **Instruction Execution:** Hold instructions that the CPU is currently executing or about to execute.
- **Addressing:** Store memory addresses used to locate data in main memory.
- **Arithmetic and Logical Operations:** Perform arithmetic and logical operations.

### Types of Registers:
- **General-Purpose Registers:** Used for various purposes such as storing data, addresses, or intermediate results.
- **Special-Purpose Registers:** Have specific functions, e.g., the Program Counter (PC) and Stack Pointer (SP).

## Cache Storage

Cache is a part of the CPU that significantly improves performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the CPU core.

### How Does Cache Work?
1. **Levels of Cache:**
   - **L1 Cache:** Smallest, fastest, and closest to the CPU core.
   - **L2 Cache:** Larger but slower than L1.
   - **L3 Cache:** Largest and slowest, often shared by multiple CPU cores.

2. **Cache Hierarchy:** 
   - The CPU first checks the L1 cache for data. If not found, it checks L2, then L3. If data isn't found in any cache, it must be fetched from the main memory, which is slower.

3. **Cache Replacement Policies:**
   - **Least Recently Used (LRU):** Evicts data that has not been accessed for the longest time.
   - **First-In-First-Out (FIFO):** Evicts the data that was first loaded into the cache.
   - **Random Replacement:** Evicts a random data item.

## Processor and Core

- **Processor:** Also known as the CPU, it is the main computational unit responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
- **Core:** A smaller unit within a processor that can execute instructions independently. A single processor can have multiple cores.

### Types of Multiprocessors:
1. **Asymmetric:** Each task is assigned to a specific processor.
2. **Symmetric:** Each processor performs all tasks.

## Operating Systems (OS)

- **Functionality:**
  - Loads the `.exe` file from the hard disk to main memory, then passes it to the CPU for sequential execution.
  - Acts as a communication bridge between the user and the hardware.

- **OS Structure:**
  1. **User OS Interface (Command Interpreter):** e.g., Shell, Command Prompt.
  2. **OS Kernel:** Manages CPU, memory, devices, and resources.

- **Primary Goal:** Convenience for users, though this may vary for different types of OS.

### Virtual Machines (VM)

- When a VM is added using a Virtual Machine Manager, it interacts with the host OS to manage hardware resources.

## Uni Programming

In **Uni Programming**, only one program is loaded into main memory at a time, leading to CPU idleness, which decreases throughput.

- **Throughput:** The number of programs completed in a unit of time.
- **Drawbacks:**
  1. Slower work completion.
  2. Wasted resources.
  3. Longer waiting times.
  4. Higher costs.

## Multi Programming

**Multi Programming** allows multiple programs to reside in memory, increasing CPU utilization.

### Types of Multi Programming:
1. **Preemptive:** Forcefully allocates and deallocates resources based on priority and time.
2. **Non-Preemptive:** No forceful allocation or deallocation.

### Degree of Multiprogramming:
- The number of processes that can be kept in main memory (RAM) at one time.

## Memory Management Unit (MMU)

An **MMU** is responsible for translating logical (virtual) addresses to physical addresses, providing memory protection, and supporting virtual memory.

| **Aspect** | **Logical Address** | **Physical Address** | **MMU** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Definition** | The address generated by the CPU. | The actual address in RAM. | Translates logical to physical addresses. |
| **Visibility** | Visible to programs. | Invisible to programs. | Functions between CPU and RAM. |
| **Purpose** | Allows independent memory usage. | Indicates actual storage location. | Provides address translation and security. |
| **Role in Virtual Memory** | Enables processes to use virtual memory. | Actual storage location in RAM or disk. | Supports virtual memory and address translation. |

### Requirements for Multi Programming OS:
1. **Secondary Memory (DMA)**
2. **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**

## Processor

The processor should support **dual mode** operations, allowing the system to handle multiple programs efficiently.
